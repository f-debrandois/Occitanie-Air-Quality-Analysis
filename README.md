# 🌱 Occitanie Air Quality Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing air pollution data from the Occitanie region, exploring various statistical modeling and data visualization techniques to understand emission patterns and their impacts.

## 📖 Description

The **Occitanie Air Quality Analysis** project is part of the ModIA formation, aiming to analyze atmospheric pollutant emissions data from the Occitanie region between 2014 and 2019. The analysis includes:
- 📊 **Descriptive Analysis**: Understanding the distribution and characteristics of pollutant emissions.
- 🌐 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualizing and interpreting emissions data in lower dimensions.
- 🏭 **Classification**: Grouping EPCIs based on their emission profiles.
- 📈 **Modeling**: Using linear and generalized linear models to explain and predict emission patterns.

This study utilizes data from **Atmo-Occitanie** and applies various statistical methods to derive insights and support environmental decision-making.
